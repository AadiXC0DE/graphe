/** The Pi adapter — the only module in Graphe allowed to touch Pi.
 *
 * notes/strategy/ARCHITECTURE.md, decision 2: Pi is pre-1.0, makes no semver
 * promise, and shipped three SDK-breaking changes in six weeks (session APIs,
 * auth moving into `ModelRuntime`, package entry points). Every Pi import lives
 * here so an upgrade breaks one file instead of fifty. Nothing below returns,
 * accepts or re-exports a Pi type: the app sees `GrapheSession`, `AgentEvent`
 * and `ToolCall` from `src/agent/types.ts`, and nothing else.
 *
 * The one Pi import is dynamic, inside `createSession`. That is not style. It
 * means the whole guard decision table and the event translation can be loaded,
 * and tested, without the SDK, a model, or a credential file anywhere in sight —
 * and it keeps Pi out of the Electron main process until somebody actually opens
 * a project.
 *
 * ## Where the Guard is wired in
 *
 * Pi has no permission system by design (decision 3), so the interception point
 * matters more here than anywhere else in the codebase. It is the `tool_call`
 * extension hook. Underneath, `AgentSession` installs that hook as the agent
 * loop's `beforeToolCall`, which runs after the tool's arguments are validated
 * and before `tool.execute` is reached; returning `{ block: true, reason }`
 * makes the loop skip execution entirely and hand `reason` back to the model as
 * the tool's error result. So a denial is both a real stop and a sentence the
 * model can read and adapt to.
 *
 * The package also exports `wrapRegisteredTool` / `wrapRegisteredTools`, which
 * look like the interception point and are not: their own doc comment says
 * "Tool call and tool result interception is handled by AgentSession via
 * agent-core hooks", and the implementation only adapts an extension-registered
 * tool's execution context and tracks newly added tool names. They never see
 * built-in `bash`, `read`, `write` or `edit` at all, which is precisely the set
 * that can destroy a project. Wrapping them would have produced a Guard that
 * passes its own tests and protects nothing.

  /**
   * Tidy a long conversation up, using Pi's own tidying and nobody else's.
   *
   * COST-DESIGN §5 and REUSE-PI.md, which is blunt about this: our "we've
   * covered a lot in here" is **a wrapper over Pi's compaction, not our own
   * summariser**. Everything below is arithmetic on two numbers Pi hands us and
   * one call to `session.compact()`. There is no prompt here, no model call of
   * ours, and no text we generate.
   *
   * ## Why we ask at all, when Pi already does this by itself
   *
   * Pi's automatic threshold is left on and is the backstop. But it fires when
   * the conversation is nearly full, which is both the most expensive moment and
   * the worst one to interrupt — it happens mid-turn, in the middle of somebody
   * waiting for an answer. Doing it a little earlier, in the gap after a turn
   * has finished, means the tidying is the only thing happening and the sentence
   * about it does not arrive on top of half a reply.
   *
   * "A little earlier" is Pi's own `shouldCompact` with Pi's own settings and a
   * larger reserve. Not a threshold of our own invention: if Pi changes how the
   * decision is made, this changes with it.
   *
   * Everything is read defensively through small holes. A Pi upgrade that moves
   * `getContextUsage` costs us the early tidy, not the session.
